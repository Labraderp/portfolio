										<h2>About</h2>
										<p>Significant real world engineering and operational experience
										to include work across $1.2B worth of government contracts and technology.</p>
									</header>
									<p>After graduating from The Citadel in May 2017, Jose commissioned into the U.S. Navy as a Cryptologic Warfare Officer and was stationed at the National Security Agency in Fort Meade, MD. 
										While there, he performed tailored asset development for National customers and performed as the Deputy On-Net Operations Officer supporting NORTHCOM 
										and SOUTHCOM National Operations. He transferred to USS BAINBRIDGE (DDG 96), ported Naval Station Norfolk at Norfolk, VA, in May 2021, 
										where he served as the Signals Warfare Officer (SIGWO), performing special collection operations during the 2021-2022 deployment of the Harry S. Truman
										Carrier Strike Group. While deployed, he was able to collect and analyze more then 1.2 million signals of interest during the onset of the Russo-Ukranian
										Conflict.
									</p>

									<p>
										Upon separating from the US Navy in August 2023, Jose was employed as a Software Engineer I at G2 Ops, Inc. in Virginia Beach, VA where he developed Java applications designed to work
										within approved DoD IL5 and IL6 environments. He also spearheaded multiple independent-development efforts to get projects off the ground or shifting directions of projects that no longer
										had significant worth in their original scope. In November 2024, Jose began work at Huntington Ingalls Industries as a Software Engineer II, where he worked as part of a development team
										that prouced wargame simulation software for Joint Combatant Commands across the globe. In June 2025, he promoted up to Functional Team Lead, where he worked on processes and architecture
										design for four different engineering teams across two different contracts to include the merge of two significantly large repositories into a single, managable repository.
